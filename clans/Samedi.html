    <h3>Bloodline Samedi</h3>
    The Samedi bloodline has a relatively short but
    immensely curious history within kindred society.
    Originating most likely in the Caribbean, the bloodline's
    members all seem to resemble a zombie or a corpse.
    Unlike the Nosferatu, who merely become disfigured,
    the body of the Samedi appears to be in a constant state of decay.
