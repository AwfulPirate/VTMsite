        The Assamites are one of the thirteen vampire clans of the Classic World of Darkness.
        Based in their hidden fortress Alamut in the Middle East, they are traditionally seen by Western Kindred
        as dangerous assassins and diablerists, but in truth they are guardians, warriors and scholars who
        seek to distance themselves from the Jyhad. Throughout their history, they have remained a self-sufficient and independent clan.
