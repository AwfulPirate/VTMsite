    <h3>Bloodline Ahrimanes</h3>
    The Ahrimanes are a rare, all-female bloodline of Kindred that originally
    existed during the Dark Ages, headed by a woman called Ádísa.
    Sometime during the long night, Ádísa and her bloodline were lost
    and subsumed into Clan Gangrel. Centuries later, the bloodline was unknowingly
    resurrected by a woman called Muricia. Since then, the Ahrimanes roam the night again,
    albeit under a different guise and leader.
