{"Ahrimanes": "The Ahrimanes are a rare, all-female bloodline of Kindred that originally existed during the Dark Ages, headed by a woman called Ádísa. Sometime during the long night, Ádísa and her bloodline were lost and subsumed into Clan Gangrel. Centuries later, the bloodline was unknowingly resurrected by a woman called Muricia. Since then, the Ahrimanes roam the night again, albeit under a different guise and leader.",
"Assamites": "The Assamites clan is based in a hidden fortress named Alamut in the Middle East. They are traditionally seen by Western Kindred as dangerous assassins and diablerists, but in truth they are guardians, warriors and scholars whoseek to distance themselves from the Jyhad. Throughout their history, they have remained a self-sufficient and independent clan.",
"Baali": "The Baali are a bloodline of vampires associated with demon worship. Because of their affinity with the unholy, the Baali are particularly vulnerable to holy iconography, holy ground and holy water. They are highly vulnerable to True Faith. Some versions present the true purpose of the Baali as keeping demons sleeping by feeding them with carnage and destruction. But most presentations show them as infernalists, using demon worship to gain additional power.",
"Brujah": "The Brujah are a major clan in Vampire: The Masquerade. Quick to anger and always passionate in the Modern Nights, they have been regaining their position as a clan of lofty philosophers and activists, and are often pointed to as a clan of unruly rebels and roughnecks that should not be messed with.",
"Caitiff": "Caitiff are vampires with no known clan. It can mean that they were abandoned and therefore do not know their lineage, or that they have no traits of the clan that they were embraced into. Caitiff have no inherent clan disciplines, but they also do not have any clan weakness. They are typically looked down upon by every other type of vampire, whether it's with distaste or pity.",
"Cappadocian": "The Cappadocians, also known as the \"Clan of Death\". Detached scholars obsessed with the mysteries of death and the soul, they are now (theoretically) extinct, having been systematically eliminated through a coup de famille conducted by Augustus Giovanni. Unfortunately for the Giovanni, they may have underestimated what it takes to kill a clan of experts on death.",
"Followers of Set": "The Followers of Set (or Setites) are a clan of vampires who believe their founder was the Egyptian god Set. Orthodox Setite belief dictates that Set will one day return to rule or consume the world, and devout Setites prepare the way for his resurrection. To this end, the clan remains independent of the Sects of other Kindred, and practice with great skill the arts of corruption, deceit and ancient sorcery.",
"Gangrel": "The Gangrel are one of the thirteen vampire clans found in the Classic World of Darkness, characterized by animalistic features and nature. Nomads who hold closer ties to the wild places than most of their city-bound cousins, they are also closer to the animal aspect of the Beast, and are masters of the Protean Discipline.",
"Harbingers of Skulls": "The Harbingers of Skulls are a rare bloodline who surfaced in the Final Nights. While few Kindred suspect the truth, they are the last remnants of the Cappadocian clan. Usually found among the Sabbat, they seek allies in their vendetta against the Giovanni and others who betrayed them.",
"Lamia": "Lamia was a bloodline of the Cappadocian clan, founded after Lamia (a rumored descendant and high priestess of Lilith). Members of this bloodline served the Cappadocians as dervishes and warriors until the purge orchestrated by the Giovanni, in 1444.",
"Samedi": "The Samedi bloodline has a relatively short but immensely curious history within kindred society. Originating most likely in the Caribbean, the bloodline's members all seem to resemble a zombie or a corpse. Unlike the Nosferatu, who merely become disfigured, the body of the Samedi appears to be in a constant state of decay."}
