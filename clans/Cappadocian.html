    <h3>Clan Cappadocian</h3>
    The Cappadocians, the "Clan of Death", were one of the thirteen vampire clans of the Classic World of Darkness.
    Detached scholars obsessed with the mysteries of death and the soul, they are now (theoretically) extinct,
    having been systematically eliminated through a coup de famille conducted by Augustus Giovanni.
    Unfortunately for the Giovanni, they may have underestimated what it takes to kill a clan of experts on death.
