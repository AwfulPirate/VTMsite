    <h3>Clan Cappadocian</h3>
    The Cappadocians, also known as the "Clan of Death".
    Detached scholars obsessed with the mysteries of death and the soul, they are now (theoretically) extinct,
    having been systematically eliminated through a coup de famille conducted by Augustus Giovanni.
    Unfortunately for the Giovanni, they may have underestimated what it takes to kill a clan of experts on death.
