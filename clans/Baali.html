<h4>Clan Baali</h4>
<p>
The Baali are a bloodline of vampires associated with demon worship. Because of their affinity with the unholy,
the Baali are particularly vulnerable to holy iconography, holy ground and holy water. They are highly vulnerable to True Faith.
Some versions present the true purpose of the Baali as keeping demons sleeping by feeding them with carnage and destruction.
But most presentations show them as Infernalists, using demon worship to gain additional power.
