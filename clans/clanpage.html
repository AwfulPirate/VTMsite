    Caitiff are vampires with no known clan. It can mean that they were
    abandoned and therefore do not know their lineage, or that they
    have no traits of the clan that they were embraced into.
    Caitiff have no inherent clan disciplines, but they also do not
    have any clan weakness. They are typically looked down upon by
    every other type of vampire, whether it's with distaste or pity.
