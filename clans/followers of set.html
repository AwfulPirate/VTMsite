    <h3>Clan Followers of Set</h3>
    The Followers of Set (or Setites) are a clan of vampires who believe their
    founder was the Egyptian god Set. Orthodox Setite belief dictates that Set
    will one day return to rule or consume the world, and devout Setites prepare
    the way for his resurrection. To this end, the clan remains independent of the
    Sects of other Kindred, and practice with great skill the arts of corruption,
    deceit and ancient sorcery.
