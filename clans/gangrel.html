    <h3>Clan Gangrel</h3>
    The Gangrel are one of the thirteen vampire clans found in the Classic World of Darkness.
    Nomads who hold closer ties to the wild places than most of their city-bound cousins,
    they are also closer to the animal aspect of the Beast, and are masters of the Protean Discipline.
