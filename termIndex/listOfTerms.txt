{"Alertness": "Alertness describes how attuned the character is to things he can see, smell, hear or touch, and depending 'on the story, perhaps things that are not so tangible. In combat, it's often paired with Wits to gauge reaction and response time. Out of combat, it works well with Perception to give the character clues about his surroundings. Alertness usually kicks in even when the character isn't necessarily looking for anything."}
