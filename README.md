# VTMsite

Made from scratch with AngularJS, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome.
Goal is to create a site for Vampire: The Masquerade where people can use an interactive character creator.
Using AngularJS to make it nice and responsive.
Doing this as a learning experience, it won't look too nice yet.

**Update** I think this project is nearly finished, as far as functionality goes, other than bug fixes.
Not to say more features won't be added in the future, but it would be considered complete by my standards.
Style, mobile use, and other pages are still on the list to finish it off, along with a couple known bugs.

Todo list:
* Add better styling
* Make the page more mobile-friendly
* Add more pages to better describe some things (paths, backgrounds, etc)
