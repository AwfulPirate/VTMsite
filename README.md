# VTMsite

Made from scratch with AngularJS, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome.
Goal is to create a site for Vampire: The Masquerade where people can use an interactive character creator.
Using AngularJS to make it nice and responsive.
Doing this as a learning experience, it won't look too nice yet.

**UPDATE 7/31/2018** 
I AM still working on this project, although it may not be apparent from the front page. check layout2 branch for my most recent changes.
I'll merge it into master branch when I feel the layout changes are finished for the most part.
After that I'll work on extra pages.

Todo list:
* Add better styling
* Make the page more mobile-friendly
* Add more pages to better describe some things (paths, backgrounds, etc)
