# VTMsite

Made from scratch with AngularJS, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome.
Goal is to create a site for Vampire: The Masquerade where people can use an interactive character creator.
Using AngularJS to make it nice and responsive.
Doing this as a learning experience, it won't look too nice yet.

Todo list:
* Add better styling
